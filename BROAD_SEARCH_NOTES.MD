Optimize Manual Search:
Instead of splitting the full_column_text for every word in every record, consider tokenizing the text once and storing it in a set or list. This can help speed up the manual search.
If your dataset is large and manual searches are frequent, consider other data structures or indexing methods to speed up text searches.
Batching: If the input search_text contains many words, the method might end up doing a lot of manual searches. Consider techniques to reduce the number of manual searches, such as batching words together or pre-filtering words based on frequency.
Return Type: Currently, the method returns a list of records. If your table has a large number of records matching the search criteria, this list could be very large. Depending on your use case, consider pagination or limiting the number of returned results.
Error Handling: You have error checks for column existence and data type. Depending on the broader application, you might want to add more error handling or validation, especially for the input search_text.

Caching: Implement a caching mechanism for frequent search queries. By storing the results of recent or frequent searches, you can reduce the need to perform the search operation again, leading to faster response times for repeated queries.
Preprocessing: Consider preprocessing the records during ingestion or update. For instance:
Convert texts to lowercase to make searches case-insensitive.
Remove punctuation or special characters if they aren't relevant for searches.
Regular Expressions: If users need more advanced search patterns, consider supporting regular expression searches.
Ranking & Relevance: Instead of returning all matching records, you could implement a ranking mechanism to return the most relevant results based on certain criteria.
Optimized Data Structures: Consider using more optimized data structures for text search, such as Trie or Suffix Trees, especially if you have prefix or substring matching requirements.
Parallel Processing: For manual searches, if the dataset is large, consider splitting the dataset and searching in parallel (using threads or multiprocessing) and then aggregating the results.
Database-Level Optimization: If you're using a database backend, ensure that you're leveraging its built-in search and indexing capabilities. Databases often have optimizations for text searches that can be more efficient than manual Python-based searches.
Limiting Word Frequency: If the STOP_WORDS list isn't exhaustive, consider dynamically building a list of high-frequency words in your dataset that might not add much value to searches and exclude them.
Feedback Loop: Implement a mechanism to gather user feedback on search results. This feedback can be used to refine and improve the search algorithm over time.
Heuristics & Machine Learning: For very advanced search functionalities, consider using heuristics or even machine learning models to predict and rank the relevance of search results based on historical data and user interactions.
Search Analytics: Monitor and analyze the search patterns of users. This can give insights into what users are commonly searching for, allowing for preemptive optimizations or business insights.
